1. Write a program to sort a list of Employee objects (name, age, salary) using lambda expressions.   

import java.util.*;

class Employee {
    String name;
    int age;
    double salary;

    public Employee(String name, int age, double salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return "Employee{name='" + name + "', age=" + age + ", salary=" + salary + "}";
    }
}

public class EmployeeSortLambda {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Employee> employees = Arrays.asList(
                new Employee("Ankita", 30, 50000),
                new Employee("Shradha", 25, 55000),
                new Employee("Deepash", 35, 45000),
                new Employee("Pooja", 28, 52000)
        );

        // Sort by name
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing(employee -> employee.name));
        System.out.println("Sorted by name: " + employees);

        // Sort by age
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingInt(employee -> employee.age));
        System.out.println("Sorted by age: " + employees);

        // Sort by salary
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparingDouble(employee -> employee.salary));
        System.out.println("Sorted by salary: " + employees);

        // Combined sorting: name, then age, then salary
        employees.sort(Comparator.comparing((Employee e) -> e.name)
                .thenComparingInt(e -> e.age)
                .thenComparingDouble(e -> e.salary));
        System.out.println("Sorted by name, then age, then salary: " + employees);
    }
}







2. Create a program to use lambda expressions and stream operations to filter students scoring above 75%, sort them by marks, and display their names.

import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

class Student {
    String name;
    double marks;

    public Student(String name, double marks) {
        this.name = name;
        this.marks = marks;
    }
}

public class StudentFilterStream {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Student> students = Arrays.asList(
                new Student("Ankita", 85),
                new Student("Shradha", 72),
                new Student("Deepash", 78),
                new Student("Pooja", 90),
        );

        // Filter students with marks > 75%, sort by marks, and display their names
        students.stream()
                .filter(student -> student.marks > 75)
                .sorted(Comparator.comparingDouble(student -> student.marks))
                .forEach(student -> System.out.println(student.name + " - " + student.marks));
    }
}
